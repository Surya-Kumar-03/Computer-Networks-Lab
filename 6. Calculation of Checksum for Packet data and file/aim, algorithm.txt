Aim: Program to perform checksum for Packet Date and file
Algorithm:
Server Side
1. Create objects of ServerSocket and Socket class
2. Create input and output buffers
3. Listen for client to connect
4. Get the data from client
5. Calculate the CRC
6. Get the CRC from client
7. If calculated CRC is same as that of received CRC, then send success
message to client
8. Else send failure message
9. Close sockets
10.Stop
Client Side
1. Create object of Socket class and connect to the server
2. Send the data along with the CRC
3. Get the response from server and print
4. Close socket
5. Stop
